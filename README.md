**BrewLab**
 - Project Overview -
BrewLab is an interactive coffee shop web application that allows users to browse menu items, customize drinks, add items to a shopping cart, and complete a checkout form.
The project demonstrates front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and local storage functionality.
This project was developed as part of a web development assignment to showcase JavaScript interactivity and dynamic content rendering.

- Project Concept -
BrewLab simulates a small café ordering system where users can:
+View available menu items
+Customize drinks by selecting size and syrup options
+Add and remove items from a cart
+See dynamic price updates
+Submit a checkout form with validation

The goal was to create a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly ordering experience.

**Features**
- Dynamic Menu Rendering -
+Menu items are generated using JavaScript.
+Each drink card is dynamically created and inserted into the DOM.
+Drink customization options (size and syrup) are conditionally displayed.

- Shopping Cart Functionality -
+Add items to cart
+Remove individual items
+Clear entire cart
+Real-time cart count update in navigation
+Total price calculation

- Drink Customization -
+Size options: Small, Medium, Large
+Syrup options: None, Vanilla, Caramel, Hazelnut
+Price recalculates dynamically based on selections

- Checkout Form -

+Input validation:
  >Cart must not be empty
  >Name cannot be blank
  >Email must be valid
+Displays confirmation message with total price
+Clears cart after successful submission
